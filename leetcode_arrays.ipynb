    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Two Pointer Pattern Mindset\n",
    "Here’s the concept that runs through most two pointer problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Use two pointers to define a sliding window. Expand it with the right pointer, and shrink it with the left pointer until it satisfies some condition.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Right pointer: expands the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Left pointer: shrinks the window when the condition is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep this concept tight in your mind**. It’s all about maintaining a window that meets the rule, and adjusting when it don’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Key Concept: How Many Subarrays?\n",
    "For every window that ends at index `right` and starts anywhere from `left` to `right`, there are:\n",
    "`right - left + 1`\n",
    "valid subarrays.\n",
    "\n",

    "* ...\n",

    "2. right = 1 → curr = 10 * 5 = 50 < 100\n",

    "## 🧠 Rules to Remember for Two Pointer Problems\n",
    "Here’s what to keep in your toolkit across all problems like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Think Sliding Window**: Are you maintaining a subarray or substring that has some valid property?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expand Right**: Let the right pointer explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shrink Left When Needed**: When the window breaks the rule, shrink it from the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Count or Save**: Once your window is valid, either:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Count how many subarrays it includes (like `right - left + 1`)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Or store something based on the window\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Window Invariant**: Keep a mental check on what your window must always satisfy. Here it’s: product < k\n",
    "\n",
    "### The line `curr //= nums[left]` is confusing, not intuitive\n",
    "Ohhh yeah, I feel you right there. That line `curr //= nums[left]` before left += 1 is sneaky, and it's a make-or-break detail for really understanding two pointer logic in sliding window problems involving **products** (not sums!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let’s break this down crystal clear:**\n",
    "### 🔁 That Whole While Loop:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while curr >= k:\n",
    "    curr //= nums[left]\n",
    "    left += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let’s flip it and break it **step-by-step**, mentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why do we divide first, then move `left`?\n",
    "Because `nums[left]` is still inside the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re saying:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"This window is now invalid (curr >= k), so let me shrink it from the left. But to do that, I gotta actually take the leftmost number out of the product, then move the left pointer over.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🧮 “Divide out `nums[left]` because I’m about to remove it from the window”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ➡️ “Now move the left pointer one step right”\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do `left += 1` before dividing, you’ve already moved past `nums[left]`, and now you don't know what you were supposed to divide by.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like throwing your receipt away before returning something. You gotta process the subtraction (or division) first, then move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔥 Analogy Mode\n",
    "Imagine your window is like a party in a room. The product of everyone’s vibe in the room gotta stay chill (less than `k`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the party gets **too hype** (product too big), you gotta kick someone out.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Who you kicking out? The leftmost dude (they been in the party longest).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. But you can’t just move the door `(left += 1)` and forget them—you gotta subtract their hype (i.e., divide their effect from the vibe counter) before they out the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "```\n",
    "curr //= nums[left]  # take the dude’s hype out\n",
    "left += 1            # now he’s officially out the party\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 🧪 Still Confused? Let’s Flip the Order (Wrong Way)\n",
    "Imagine this mistake:\n",
    "```\n",
    "left += 1\n",
    "curr //= nums[left]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you skipped over the element that needed to be removed from `curr` 😬\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s like *moving on* before cleaning up. You're now dividing by the wrong guy.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 🧩 Prefix Sum Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s define a **prefix sum** as the cumulative sum of the array starting from index 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prefix_sum[i] = nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The running total at each step i is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "running_total[i] = startValue + prefix_sum[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 🚫 Where I Went Wrong\n",
    "In my original code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if sum(prefix) < 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "I checked the **sum of all prefix sums**, which doesn’t actually tell me whether **any individual running total dropped below 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>*✅ What I should’ve done is track the minimum value that the prefix sum ever hits.*</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ The Correct Logic\n",
    "We want:\n",
    "```\n",
    "startValue + prefix_sum[i] ≥ 1  for all i\n",
    "```\n",
    "This implies:\n",
    "```\n",
    "startValue ≥ 1 - min(prefix_sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "So the correct `startValue` is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "startValue = 1 - min(prefix_sum)\n",
    "```"

    "## K Radius Subarray Averages\n",
    "You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of `n` integers, and an integer `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **k-radius average** for a subarray of `nums` **centered** at some index `i` with the **radius** `k` is the average of **all** elements in `nums` between the indices `i - k` and `i + k` (**inclusive**). If there are less than `k` elements before or after the index `i`, then the **k-radius average** is `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build and return an array `avgs` of length `n` where `avgs[i]` is the **k-radius average** for the subarray centered at index `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **average** of `x` elements is the sum of the `x` elements divided by `x`, using **integer division**. The integer division truncates toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the average of four elements `2`, `3`, `1`, and `5` is `(2 + 3 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75`, which truncates to `2`.\n",

    "```\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "- avg[0], avg[1], and avg[2] are -1 because there are less than k elements before each index.\n",
    "- The sum of the subarray centered at index 3 with radius 3 is: 7 + 4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 37.\n",
    "  Using integer division, avg[3] = 37 / 7 = 5.\n",
    "- For the subarray centered at index 4, avg[4] = (4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2) / 7 = 4.\n",
