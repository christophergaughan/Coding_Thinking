    "* The main advantage of a linked list is that you can add and remove elements at any position in $O(1)$.\n",
    "*The caveat is that you need to have a reference to a node at the position in which you want to perform the addition/removal, otherwise the operation is $O(n)$, because you will need to iterate starting from the `head` until you get to the desired position.* However, this is still **much better than a normal (dynamic) array**, which requires $O(n)$ for adding and removing from an arbitrary position.\n",
    "* The main disadvantage of a linked list is that **there is no random access**.\n",
    "If you have a large linked list and want to access the 150,000th element, then there usually isn't a better way than to start at the head and iterate 150,000 times. So while an array has $O(1)$ indexing, a linked list **could require $O(n)$ to access an element at a given position**.\n",

    "## Key Concepts You're Supposed to Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What a Node Actually Is**\n",
    "Each `ListNode` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stores a value (`val`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stores a pointer to the next node (`next`)\n",
    "\n",
    "So if `one = ListNode(1)`, then:\n",
    "```\n",
    "one.val → 1\n",
    "one.next → None (by default)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **How Nodes Are Linked Together**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You manually connect them using `.next`\n",
    "```\n",
    "one.next = two\n",
    "two.next = three\n",
    "```\n",
    "Creates a chain:\n",
    "`[1] → [2] → [3] → None`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What `head` Represents**\n",
    "\n",
    "head is the pointer to the start of the linked list. It's your entry point to the chain. Even though you're creating `one`, `two`, `three` — you traverse the list starting from `head`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How to Access Data via `.next`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(head.next.next.val)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Is a real-time traversal through the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `head` → node with value `1`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `head.next` → node with value `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `head.next.next` → node with value `3`\n",
    "\n",
    "So you're walking:\n",
    "\n",
    "`1 step → 2 steps → then grabbing `.val`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Understanding the Structure Visually**\n",
    "```\n",
    "head\n",
    " ↓\n",
    "[1] → [2] → [3] → None\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each `print()` just shows you that the chain is real, and you can walk it one `.next` at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "* You build lists by connecting nodes manually (with `.next`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* You walk the list one step at a time (`node = node.next`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* *You only have access to what `head` points to* — so if you lose `head`, **you lose the list**\n",

    "You're creating a `class` → a blueprint for a type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A class defines the structure and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An object is a specific instance of that structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Node` is the class (aka the blueprint).\n",

    "\n",
    "* Every node in a linked list needs to know *where the next node* is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* But when you first create a node, *it has no link to any other node yet*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So you explicitly set `self.next = None` to show:\n",
