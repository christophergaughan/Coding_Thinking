    "### 🔧 Optimization Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Explanation |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **No unnecessary deletion (`del`)** | The code avoids deleting keys from the hashmap, which saves time. Deleting keys from a Python dictionary can cause internal rehashing and is more costly than leaving a key with a `0` value. |\n",
    "| **Focused logic** | The loop checks only what matters — whether the frequency of the current number exceeds `k`. There's no use of `len(count)` or unnecessary operations. |\n",
    "| **Minimal operations inside the loop** | The sliding window is tight and only adjusts when the frequency constraint is broken. The `left` pointer is moved only as needed. |\n",
    "| **No overengineering** | No additional flags, sets, or over-complicated logic. The code uses exactly what the problem requires and nothing more. |\n",
    "| **O(n) time complexity** | Each element is processed at most twice (once when added to the window, once when removed), making it linear in time. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Strategic Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hashmap (`defaultdict`)** is used for tracking frequencies in constant time.\n",
    "- **Sliding window** dynamically adjusts the valid subarray bounds.\n",
    "- Skipping `del` improves performance without affecting correctness, since the algorithm never depends on `len(count)` or the exact keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Performance Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Cost with `del` | Cost without `del` |\n",
    "|-----------|------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| Key deletion | Can trigger rehashing, adds overhead | Avoided entirely |\n",
    "| Window updates | Slower due to extra operations | Faster with cleaner logic |\n",

    "## 🧠 FAANG-Ready Explanation: Sliding Window + HashMap for Frequency Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Problem Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find the length of the **longest contiguous subarray** (i.e., sliding window) such that **no element appears more than `k` times**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This immediately signals a **sliding window pattern** because:\n",
    "- We're dealing with a **subarray**, which means the elements must be contiguous.\n",
    "- We need to track what's happening **inside the window in real time**.\n",
    "- The constraint is **per-element frequency**, which points directly to a **hashmap** (`dict` or `defaultdict`) to keep count.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Approach Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I use a **sliding window** with two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the current window and a hashmap (`count`) to track the frequency of each number within the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As I move `right` forward, I add elements to the window and update their counts.\n",
    "- If any element exceeds the allowed frequency `k`, I increment `left` to shrink the window until the window is valid again.\n",
    "- At each valid window, I track the maximum length seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that I always maintain a **valid subarray**, and I only expand or contract the window when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 🧠 Why I Avoided `del count[...]`\n",

    "In some implementations, people clean up the dictionary like this:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Example cleanup (optional):\n",
