    "\n",
    "## 1. Dynamic Size (Advantage)\n",
    "- Linked lists do **not** have a fixed size.\n",
    "- Arrays (even dynamic ones like Python lists) are built on **fixed-size memory blocks**.\n",
    "- When a dynamic array exceeds its capacity:\n",
    "  - It must **allocate new space** (usually 2x the size).\n",
    "  - Then **copy all elements** over → costly operation ($O(n)$ time).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. No Resizing Cost (Advantage)\n",
    "- Linked lists avoid this resizing cost.\n",
    "- You can keep adding nodes without reallocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Space Overhead (Disadvantage)\n",
    "- Each linked list node stores:\n",
    "  - The **value**\n",
    "  - A **pointer** to the next (or previous) node\n",
    "- This adds **extra memory usage**, especially painful when:\n",
    "  - You're storing small items like `bool`, `char`, or tiny integers\n",
    "  - Memory efficiency really matters\n",
    "\n",

    "head = head.next\n",
    "head = None\n",

    "```\n",
    "ptr ——→ [1] → [2] → [3] → None\n",
    "head ——↑\n",
    "```\n",
    "They are **aliases** to the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Step 2: head = head.next\n",
    "Now head jumps forward to point to [2].\n",
    "ptr still points to [1].\n",

    "To demonstrate how **pointer assignment works** in a linked list.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What They're Teaching:\n",
    "1. `ptr = head`\n",
    "   - This creates a **copy of the reference**, not a copy of the list.\n",
    "   - Both `ptr` and `head` now point to the same node.\n",

    "   - `head` moves to the second node.\n",

    "## Key Concepts You're Supposed to Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What a Node Actually Is**\n",
    "Each `ListNode` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stores a value (`val`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stores a pointer to the next node (`next`)\n",
    "\n",
    "So if `one = ListNode(1)`, then:\n",
    "```\n",
    "one.val → 1\n",
    "one.next → None (by default)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **How Nodes Are Linked Together**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You manually connect them using `.next`\n",
    "```\n",
    "one.next = two\n",
    "two.next = three\n",
    "```\n",
    "Creates a chain:\n",
    "`[1] → [2] → [3] → None`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What `head` Represents**\n",
    "\n",
    "head is the pointer to the start of the linked list. It's your entry point to the chain. Even though you're creating `one`, `two`, `three` — you traverse the list starting from `head`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How to Access Data via `.next`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(head.next.next.val)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Is a real-time traversal through the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `head` → node with value `1`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `head.next` → node with value `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `head.next.next` → node with value `3`\n",
    "\n",
    "So you're walking:\n",
    "\n",
    "`1 step → 2 steps → then grabbing `.val`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Understanding the Structure Visually**\n",
    "```\n",
    "head\n",
    " ↓\n",
    "[1] → [2] → [3] → None\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each `print()` just shows you that the chain is real, and you can walk it one `.next` at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "* You build lists by connecting nodes manually (with `.next`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* You walk the list one step at a time (`node = node.next`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* *You only have access to what `head` points to* — so if you lose `head`, **you lose the list**\n",
    "\n",

    "**What’s Going On here?**\n",
    "You're creating a `class` → a blueprint for a type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A class defines the structure and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An object is a specific instance of that structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Node` is the class (aka the blueprint).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Node(1)`, `Node(2)`, etc. are actual objects created from that blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why `self.next = None`?\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "* You're setting a **default** — a new node starts as a \"standalone unit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every node in a linked list needs to know *where the next node* is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* But when you first create a node, *it has no link to any other node yet*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So you explicitly set `self.next = None` to show:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “This node doesn’t point to anything — yet.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## ☣️ If You Don’t Do This:☢️☣\n",
    "You’ll get an `AttributeError` later when you try to say:\n",
    "`node.next = another_node`\n",
    "\n",
    "If `.next` was never defined in `__init__`, Python will throw a fit because `.next` doesn’t exist yet.\n",

    "### Real-Life Analogy\n",

    "When you first build a train car, it doesn’t know who it’s linking to — so the hook is empty (None). Later on, you attach it to another car.\n",

    "#### OOP Benefits (Even in This Tiny Class)\n",
    "**Encapsulation**: Your data (`val`, `next`) lives inside each node\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reusability**: You can create as many nodes as you want from one blueprint\n",
